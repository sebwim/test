      faqs:
        collaborator:
          answer: This is the total number of unique Lingohub users that you can invite to the private projects in your account with project access. A given user only counts once, regardless of the number of private projects in your account that he or she is a member of.
          question: What does the term ‘collaborator’ mean?
        data:
          answer: The security and privacy of your personal, payment, and project information is very important to us. Lingohub runs in an enterprise grade, SAS70-compliant data center, we employ industry standard means to protect your data, and all plans on Lingohub are SSL-encrypted.
          question: Is my data safe?
        decide:
          answer: Yes, you can start with the plan that suits your needs today, and upgrade later. If you’re on a paid plan and upgrade to a higher priced plan, you will be charged a prorated amount based on the remaining time in the current billing cycle. Don’t forget there is a 14-day free trial to discover Lingohub - and for translators Lingohub will always be free.
          question: I’m not sure which plan I need, can I decide later?
        downgrade:
          answer: Paid accounts can be downgraded or cancelled at any time, and you will not be charged again - you pay for full months. We do not offer refunds for charges that have already been incurred, so we advise starting with the plan that meets your needs today, and upgrading later as your agile project management needs change.
          question: What happens when I downgrade plans?
        free:
          answer: Yes, Lingohub can be used as a free translation tool. The free plan includes our translation editor without any restrictions. If you are a translator, you can use Lingohub for free - always. What requires paid plans is hosting your own commercial translations projects.
          question: Can I use Lingohub for free?
        more:
          answer: Please visit our Support page, or contact us directly. Small print is available under <a href='https://lingohub.com/terms'>Terms of Service</a>.
          question: Need more information?
        public_projects:
          answer: By default, all projects in Lingohub are private, and accessible only to users you explicitly invite. Public projects are visible to anyone, and are intended for use in open source software development, or any initiative that does not require data privacy. Public projects do not count toward project or collaborator limits on any plan.
          question: What are public projects?
        title: Frequently Asked Questions
        trial:
          answer: When you sign up for Lingohub, your account will be automatically enrolled in the free 14-day trial (unlimited features, projects and team members). You can choose one of the paid plans at any time prior to the end of the 14-day period. At the end of the trial, your account will transition to the free individual plan, which is aimed at translators and collaborators. You can use all features and participate in other projects, but cannot create projects yourself. If your account is over these limits, your projects will become read-only (you will not lose any data). No credit card is required for the free 14-day trial. You can use the trial anyway, at this point it is not relevant whether you are just a translator or if you want to host your own projects.
          question: How does the free 14-day Trial work?
